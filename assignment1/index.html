          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Bruce Schneier is an internationally renowned security technologist
            and cryptographer. He has been called a
            <strong>“security guru”</strong> by The Economist and has authored
            over a dozen influential books on cryptography, computer security,
            and privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is an Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy
            School and a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &
            Society. His career spans pioneering cryptographic algorithms,
            security systems, and an authoritative voice on global security
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in 1963 in Brooklyn, New York, Schneier graduated with a
            physics degree before transitioning to computer science. He
            revolutionized cryptography education with his 1994 book,
            <em>Applied Cryptography</em>, which remains a foundational text.
            Over decades, Schneier has influenced cybersecurity protocols and
            advocated for privacy rights worldwide.

          <h2>Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            Bruce Schneier’s work spans theoretical cryptography to practical
            security applications used in everyday technology. His notable
            creations include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blowfish, Twofish, and Threefish block ciphers</li>
            <li>Fortuna and Yarrow random number generation algorithms</li>
            <li>Skein hash function</li>
            <li>Stream ciphers like Solitaire, Phelix, and Helix</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            He has also advanced security thinking through books like
            <em>Secrets and Lies</em> and <em>Beyond Fear</em>, helping society
            navigate digital risks with reason and frameworks for trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Schneier co-founded Counterpane Internet Security, developed thought
            leadership on power dynamics in cybersecurity, and continues to
            serve on advisory boards for major privacy organizations including
            the Electronic Frontier Foundation and The Tor Project.
